A project from around 2020 that never went anywhere.
The goal was to automatically translate manga.
My idea was to use a classical CV algorithm to extract text bubbles,
then OCR them and finally make web requests to Google Translate for translations
(a hacky way to get decent translations for free).

For some reason, despite not even having a POC, this received mutliple stars, which I'm keeping for now 😛.
